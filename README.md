# Whiteboarding Challenges

These are examples of whiteboarding questions I have encountered in the real world, paired with my solutions.

## Missing Number
>Given a list of numbers that contains two of each integer from 1 through n, find the number that is missing from the list.
>*Extra credit*: Write the function without loops.

## BST Has Data
>Given the root of a binary search tree and some data, determine if that data is in the tree.

## Huffman Decoding
>Given the root node of a Huffman tree and an encoded string, return the decoded string. [*More info*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

## Reverse Linked List
>Given a singly-linked-list head node, reverse the list in place.
