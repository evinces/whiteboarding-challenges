# Whiteboarding Challenges


These are expamles of whiteboarding questions I have encountered in the real world, paired with my solutions.

> *Missing Number*
> Given a list of numbers that contains two of each integer from 1 through n, find the number that is missing from the list.
> _Extra credit:_
> Write the function without loops.

> *BST Has Data*
> Given the root of a binary search tree and some data, determine if that data is in the tree.

> *Huffman Decoding*
> Given the root node of a Huffman tree and an encoded string, return the decoded string.
> _Background:_
> With Huffman encoding, strings can be converted to a non-fixed number of ones and zeroes by storing data at the leaf nodes of a binary tree and describing utilizing the left and right pointers as decoding points where zero would mean go left and a one would mean go right.

> *Reverse Linked List*
> Given a singly-linked-list head node, reverse the list in place.
